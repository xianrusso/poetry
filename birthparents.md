## Birth Parents

Swaddled in honey arms  
That tossed me like toads

Leap and bound, stone to stone.  
Syncopated breaths in wormy

Closet full of severed skulls  
White as blind innocence.

My porcelain spirit  
Tumbles along the bottom

Of shallow stream  
Sharpened by whet stone.

My spirit shatters and breaks  
Excreting questions of

Where you went,  
What is home.
