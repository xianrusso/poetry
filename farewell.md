##Farewell

Alabster funeral:  
The impending grey of age.  
I, devoid  
Of hue and color,  
Doff my cap to the demure,  
Old Polish woman frocked in nothing.  

Eagles bellow beneath falling acorns.  
Soundless noises.  
School children march in cadence  
To the roaring blizzard;  

A choir of coal. Ash  
Is all that reamains,  
Residue of time once was.  

Hope glimmers on the  
Scales of trout, but vanishes  
By night's reach.  

What is lost never ceases.  
This feeling:  

...
