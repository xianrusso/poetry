Doe-eyed and soot-faced,  
He ventured into my locked-thoughts and  
Whistled incantations that dismembered  
Me, atom to atom.  

Then he found life unbearable:  
One day here, the next --  
Poof!  

Only his spell remained...  
And two scandalous rumours...  

One:  
He saw things,  
Things that were not there,  
Things that only he could see:  
Red gods and black titans,  
Mushy brain in snow-white skulls  
Larvae blooming like sunflowers.  

Two:  
He and another man  
Might have danced  
Innapropriately  
With my best friend  
Against her better sense  
Or any sense at all.  

Wide-eyed and dead,
Hooks in the corners of his mouth,    
Veiled underneath the innocent  
Soil.
