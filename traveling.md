I've been reading too much
Bukowski

Now everything's poetry:

Dogs
Dogs shitting
Dogs barking

People
People shitting
With mouth and anus

I camp on a Croatian island with two German
	boys.  They ask me if I 

Sprechen zie Deutsch,

"Die kacke ist am dampfan,"

They laugh like wind.

I hop a ferry with them and
Let them take the first island while
I conquer the second.

My feet lead me
Through brush and bramble
THrough the backyard of lovemakers
Choking each other out
Scaring the crows
And me.

I stumble into a secluded cove
And set up my camp in the
Starlight and swim in
Sea dark as ink.

I repose on pebble shores
Spark a joint
And think

"Another two years of this?"
