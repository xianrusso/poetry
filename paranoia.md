##Farewell

Alabster funeral:  
Imprisoned in the casket while  
Corteg√© tramples on the soil above.    

In darkness I hear whispered  
Screams so close the warmth of a  
Wet tongue trickles down my spine  
Like sharp swords that bounce off steel walls
And lacerate my guts.  

DIE, DIE, DIE  
they chant,  
KILL, KILL, KILL  
they plead  

And I strangle them all slow  
And methodical like a  
Chemist pouring liquid in  
To a new flask, a new life.  

Eagles bellow beneath falling acorns;  
Silence shrouds the noise; a cork seals a bottle;  
Writhing like a worm in the desert,  
I accept the cosmos for what they are:  

Devoid of soul,  
A void of winter,  
Except for the summer solstice  
When that old, familiar voice returns  
And everything is alright.
